							<br/>
                            <p class="my-font"><b>The Gavai Swad Agro Products P Limited</b> (Gavai Swad) is a company founded in 2020
								during the lockdown period when the food services were not available in offline mode for window shopping.</p>
                            <p class="my-font">The vision behind starting <b>“Gavai Swad”</b> is to provide the real taste of India and the real
							products made out of desi raw material. Nowadays, getting <b><i>Organic fruits and vegetables</i></b> is
							next to impossible since adulteration has become a common practice. Unlike conventional
							ones which are coated with waxes and sprayed with chemicals, basically mummifying them.
							We, at Gavai Swad treat <b><i>nature</i></b> as it should be and provide a wide variety of the freshest
							possible products free from harmful pesticides and chemicals, that disrupt our physical health
							and mental wellbeing.</p>

							<p class="my-font">We offer a range of products like: <b><i>Sugarcane sirka, pickles, murabba, jaggery products</i></b> to our
							customers freshly made without using any chemicals &amp; pesticides. Since now all of us are
							getting more internet &amp; technology savvy and we all want the services at our doorstep and
							therefore gavaiswad.com portal came into existence.</p>
							<p class="my-font"><b>The products of Gavai Swad are available on Amazon, Flipkart, Swiggy &amp; other e-commerce
							based food portals.</b></p>
